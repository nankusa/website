## Overview

SpbNet is a deep learning framework for crystal structure analysis and material property prediction. This interactive demo showcases:

- **3D Molecular Visualization**: View crystal structures in 3D
- **Property Prediction**: Predict adsorption, separation, and intrinsic properties
- **Attention Visualization**: Visualize attention scores from the neural network

## Getting Started

1. Select an example crystal structure or enter a CIF ID
2. Explore different property types using the tabs
3. View detailed predictions and visualizations

## Features

### Adsorption Prediction
Predict adsorption capacities for various gases including CO₂, CH₄, N₂, and H₂.

### Separation Prediction
